    <h4>My essay about the Internet</h4>

    <p id="essay" class="first">The Internet is an amazing place that has revolutionized the way that we do things today.  I mean we are doing everything on this thing!
      I honestly can't even think about what my life was like before I had the internet available as a common thing.
      It has become so important in everything that we do, that if there isn't a site for something, it feels like it isn't relavant anymore.
      You have to admit, that is a pretty powerful impact.</p>
    <p id="essay" class="second">Since the dawn of the internet, things have been changing non-stop.  I mean, it started out as a basic platform to send files back and forth.
      Then it became a place you could go and "browse" the web and loook at pictures or articles.  Even watch videos on demand(no pun intended)!  It started
      to transition so much, and so quickly, that before we knew it, it was more than we could have ever asked for.  From the empty abyss of text, to the glorious
      visual sites that we have today.</p>
    <p id="essay" class="third"; >The future of the internet is something I can't wait to see.  One day we will be able to do things on the web that would literally blow our minds today.
      Between the types of functionality and visual aspects we can expect to grow from what we have is limitless.  I want to be a part of that future, do YOU?</p>
